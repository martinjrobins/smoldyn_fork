# polymer1.txt

/*

This file defines a single species, X, which has left and right binding sites.
Left and right binding sites bind each other, meaning that X can polymerize.
For the reaction X + X <-> XX, the association rate is 20 and dissociation rate
is 1.  A problem used to arise with reaction mzr8, which is for trimer dissociation:
XXX -> XX + X.  The generated dissociation rate constant was 1 but is now
2 because there are two possible break points.  This problem has been fixed.

In general, for symmetric dissociation (e.g. XX -> X + X, or XXXX -> XX + XX),
the dissociation rate constant should be 1.  For asymmetric dissociation (e.g.
XXX -> XX + X, or XXXX -> XXX + X), the dissociation rate constant should be 2.

The above rule is general for this system, but I don't know how to generalize
it to all systems.
