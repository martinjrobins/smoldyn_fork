# abaccc.txt

/*
This file makes the complex C-A-B-A-C, and all subcomplexes.  They are
A, B, AB, BA, ABA, C, CA, CAB, BAC, CABA, ABAC, and CABAC
The file used to also enable binding of C to B, but that's commented out currently.
Note that CAB and BAC are different complexes because the B mol is asymmetric
(it has distinguishable left and right binding sites).

There are 38 possible reactions and Libmzr finds all of them correctly.
To enumerate reactions, note that each species can divide at each site;
e.g. CABAC has 4 dissociation reactions, CABA has 3, etc.
