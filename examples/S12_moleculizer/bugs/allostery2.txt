# allostery2.txt
# This model demonstrates the use of allostery in a model using an
# allosteric-class.  Receptor molecules bind to Ligand in a standard
# association reaction.  Receptor molecules can also bind to
# Messengers when their Msite is in the Active form.  A
# rule in the allosteric-classes section specifies Receptor.Ligand
# subcomplexes change Receptor's Msite from Occluded to
# Active.

/*
The largest complex in this file is Ligand-Receptor-Messenger, called LRM.  The full list of complexes
is: Ligand, Receptor, Messenger, LR, RM, and LRM.

Receptor's messenger site, Msite, is active when the ligand is bound and is otherwise occluded.

This file appears to work adequately.

However, a major inelegancy is that the species-class, as defined below, includes a binding site shape,
which is ignored.  The class called "activeclass" should only include species with active receptors, which
are LR and LRM.  It actually includes everything with a receptor, which are Receptor, LR, RM, and LRM.

Ideally, species-classes could be defined that accounted for shapes.
A less good option would be for species-classes to forbid the listing of binding site shapes.
