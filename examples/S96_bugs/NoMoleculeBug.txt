/*
Smoldyn file submitted to me by Max Hoffman 9/6/11.

This file doesn't actually do anything because there are no molecules
at time 0.  If I add a single molecule to the initial system, as in the
commented-out line below, then this fixes the problem and the simulation
runs.  I haven't figured out why the simulation won't run without any
molecules.

This might be an OpenGL glut problem.  If I try to debug by adding a line
to simulatetimestep that simply prints out the time at each time step, then
that fixes the bug.  Also, if I run in gdb, then the bug either happens or
doesn't happen depending on what break points I set.
